# pythonReverseShellServer.py

Reverse Shell python script. Just open the Server file and set the IP address and the port number.

This will open the port on your attacking machine and wait for the client python script to be clicked on the victim machine.

Client file should be modified to contain the attackers IP address and port number (This information should match the Server script).  Find a way to get the victim to click on the file and you will have a reverse shell.  ***Server script must already be running***
